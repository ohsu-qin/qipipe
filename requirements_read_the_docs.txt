# The requirements for a ReadTheDocs build only. This file excludes
# the following packages:
# * nibabel
# * any packages which depend on nibabel
# * mpi4py
#
# This requirement subset works around the following problems:
#
# * ReadTheDocs build fails on nibabel and dependent packages, since
#   numpy must be built before the requirements are even collected,
#   as explained in the qipipe Installation Guide. ReadTheDocs does
#   not support this customization. This is not a problem with the
#   two-stage conda/pip install, but ReadTheDocs is a distutils-only
#   install.
#
# * ReadTheDocs build fails on mpi4py, since the environment cannot
#   build MPI programs.
#
# TODO - mpi4py is OHSU-specific. Move to ohsu-qipipe when that is
# available and eliminate the comment above.
