    The StagingWorkflow class builds and executes the staging Nipype workflow.
    The staging workflow includes the following steps:

    - Group the input DICOM images into volume.

    - Fix each input DICOM file header using the
      :class:`qipipe.interfaces.fix_dicom.FixDicom` interface.

    - Compress each corrected DICOM file.

    - Upload each compressed DICOM file into XNAT.

    - Stack each new volume's 2-D DICOM files into a 3-D volume NiFTI file
      using the DcmStack_ interface.

    - Upload each new volume stack into XNAT.

    - Make the CTP_ QIN-to-TCIA subject id map.

    - Collect the id map and the compressed DICOM images into a target
      directory in collection/subject/session/volume format for TCIA
      upload.

    The staging workflow input is the *input_spec* node consisting of
    the following input fields:

    - *collection*: the collection name

    - *subject*: the subject name

    - *session*: the session name

    - *scan*: the scan number

    The staging workflow has two iterables:

    - the *iter_volume* node with input fields *volume* and *dest*

    - the *iter_dicom* node with input fields *volume* and *dicom_file*

    These iterables must be set prior to workflow execution. The
    *iter_volume* *dest* input is the destination directory for
    the *iter_volume* *volume*.

    The *iter_dicom* node *itersource* is the ``iter_volume.volume``
    field. The ``iter_dicom.dicom_file`` iterables is set to the
    {volume: [DICOM files]} dictionary.

    The DICOM files to upload to TCIA are placed in the destination
    directory in the following hierarchy:

        ``/path/to/dest/``
          *subject*\ /
            *session*\ /
              ``volume``\ *volume number*\ /
                *file*
                ...

    where:

    * *subject* is the subject name, e.g. ``Breast011``

    * *session* is the session name, e.g. ``Session03``

    * *volume number* is determined by the
      :attr:`qipipe.staging.collection.Collection.patterns`
      :attr:`qipipe.staging.collection.Patterns.volume` DICOM tag

    * *file* is the DICOM file name

    The staging workflow output is the *output_spec* node consisting
    of the following output field:

    - *image*: the 3D volume stack NiFTI image file
