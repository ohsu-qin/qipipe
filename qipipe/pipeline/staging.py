class StagingWorkflow(WorkflowBase):
    """
    The StagingWorkflow class builds and executes the staging Nipype workflow.
    The staging workflow includes the following steps:

    - Group the input DICOM images into volume.

    - Fix each input DICOM file header using the
      :class:`qipipe.interfaces.fix_dicom.FixDicom` interface.

    - Compress each corrected DICOM file.

    - Upload each compressed DICOM file into XNAT.

    - Stack each new volume's 2-D DICOM files into a 3-D volume NiFTI file
      using the DcmStack_ interface.

    - Upload each new volume stack into XNAT.

    - Make the CTP_ QIN-to-TCIA subject id map.

    - Collect the id map and the compressed DICOM images into a target
      directory in collection/subject/session/volume format for TCIA
      upload.

    The staging workflow input is the *input_spec* node consisting of
    the following input fields:

    - *collection*: the collection name

    - *subject*: the subject name

    - *session*: the session name

    - *scan*: the scan number

    The staging workflow has two iterables:

    - the *iter_volume* node with input fields *volume* and *dest*

    - the *iter_dicom* node with input fields *volume* and *dicom_file*

    These iterables must be set prior to workflow execution. The
    *iter_volume* *dest* input is the destination directory for
    the *iter_volume* *volume*.

    The *iter_dicom* node *itersource* is the ``iter_volume.volume``
    field. The ``iter_dicom.dicom_file`` iterables is set to the
    {volume: [DICOM files]} dictionary.

    The DICOM files to upload to TCIA are placed in the destination
    directory in the following hierarchy:

        ``/path/to/dest/``
          *subject*\ /
            *session*\ /
              ``volume``\ *volume number*\ /
                *file*
                ...

    where:

    * *subject* is the subject name, e.g. ``Breast011``

    * *session* is the session name, e.g. ``Session03``

    * *volume number* is determined by the
      :attr:`qipipe.staging.collection.Collection.patterns`
      :attr:`qipipe.staging.collection.Patterns.volume` DICOM tag

    * *file* is the DICOM file name

    The staging workflow output is the *output_spec* node consisting
    of the following output field:

    - *image*: the 3D volume stack NiFTI image file

    Note: Concurrent XNAT upload fails unpredictably, possibly
        arising from one of the following causes:
        * the pyxnat config in $HOME/.xnat/xnat.cfg specifies a temp
          directory that *is not* shared by all concurrent jobs,
          resulting in inconsistent cache content
        * the pyxnat config in $HOME/.xnat/xnat.cfg specifies a temp
          directory that *is* shared by some concurrent jobs,
          resulting in unsynchronized pyxnat write conflicts across
          jobs
        * the non-reentrant pyxnat's custom non-http2lib cache is
          corrupted
        * an XNAT archive directory access race condition

        The cause cannot be isolated for the following reasons:
        * there is no useful Nipype error or log message
        * the error is sporadic and unreproducible
        * Nipype swallows non-nipype Python log messages, causing the
          upload and pyxnat log messages to disappear

        Update 05/12/2015 - there are three potential failure points:
        * Concurrent pyxnat cache access corrupts the cache resulting in
          unpredictable errors, e.g. attempt to create an existing XNAT
          object
        * Concurrent XNAT resource file upload corrupts the archive such
          that the files are stored in the archive but are not recognized
          by XNAT
        * XNAT upload SGE plug-in cluster tasks exceed time or memory limits

        These errors are addressed by the following measures:
        * setting an isolated pyxnat cache_dir for each execution node
        * serializing the XNAT access points with JoinNodes
        * increasing the SGE submission resource parameters. The following
          setting is adequate:
             h_rt=02:00:00,mf=32M
